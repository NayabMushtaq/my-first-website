The day began like any other, with the sun rising over cities that hummed with life, unaware that the sky itself was about to betray them. In distant command centers, red lights blinked, sirens wailed, and voices trembled as the unthinkable order was given: all nuclear arsenals would be released. The first flashes erupted over the oceans, invisible at first, but the shockwaves raced toward continents with the force of a thousand storms. Cities vaporized in an instant, leaving only ash and twisted metal where skyscrapers once stood. Windows shattered miles away, sending shards slicing through the air like deadly rain. Those who survived the initial blasts faced a hell far worse than fire—the air itself became a weapon, carrying radiation that poisoned lungs, soil, and water alike.

In the hours that followed, a sickly orange sky blanketed the world, illuminated by the mushroom clouds of thousands of explosions. Streets became rivers of fire, carrying the remnants of vehicles, buildings, and people. The screams of those caught in the chaos echoed in the distance, blending with the roar of collapsing infrastructure and the relentless hum of nuclear engines still churning in the skies. Animals, disoriented and terrified, fled blindly into destruction, their cries adding a haunting soundtrack to a planet on the edge of collapse. Power grids failed everywhere, and a silence fell over the cities not yet touched, the eerie calm before the final wave of devastation.</p>

<p>By nightfall, the consequences were almost unimaginable. Oceans boiled, and rivers turned to steam; crops burned before even being harvested, leaving the world on the brink of famine. The skies rained radioactive ash that coated everything in a ghostly gray, searing skin, and corroding metal. Survivors huddled in underground bunkers or collapsed basements, but no shelter could completely shield them from the invisible hand of death that seeped through walls, cracks, and ventilation. Governments collapsed, communication networks failed, and humanity fractured into scattered, terrified pockets. The planet itself seemed to mourn, quaking under the pressure of firestorms, collapsing cities, and the relentless pulse of nuclear winter that would soon choke the sun’s warmth from the surface.

By the next day, the world was unrecognizable. What had once been vibrant metropolises were nothing but smoldering ruins. Rivers of molten debris ran through empty streets where echoes of laughter and life had once existed. The survivors, few and broken, wandered among the skeletal remains of their civilization, tasting dust and despair. The sky remained a permanent twilight, an eternal reminder that the arrogance of mankind had ignited the end. No bird sang, no wind stirred without carrying the scent of death, and the Earth, scarred and bleeding, became a tomb for everything that had once walked its surface.
